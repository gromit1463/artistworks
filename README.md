# Code Challenge: ArtistWorks

**DISCLAIMER:** Prior to this exercise, I had exactly zero (0) knowledge or experience with Vue/Nuxt. I watched a 3-hour Vue crash course on YouTube, drawing on my React experience to understand it, then I spent a day reimplementing parts of my current React side project in Vue/Nuxt3 to get a feel for it. Also, I had a lot of trouble getting TailwindCSS to play well with my Nuxt3 environment, so I abandoned that entirely and decided to hand-write all of the CSS. (I'm faster with hand-written CSS than Tailwind classes right now anyway.)

## Implmentation

I implemented a "working" log in screen. Enter `demo` for the username and password to "log in." The form does respond to pressing the Enter key to submit, as well as clicking the Continue button. The Google and Apple buttons are actual buttons, but they don't do anything.

On the Lesson Overview screen, if I had time I would have made the dropdown functional, although it is an actual button.

## Accessibility

I tried to implement the UI keeping in mind accessibility best practices: buttons, images with `alt` text, links, semantic HTML, etc.

## Responsiveness

Both screens are fully responsive from mobile up to large desktop.
